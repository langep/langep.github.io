What is speech-controlled? For me, speech-controlled is a platform to share my
ideas and speech-related projects with you. It is also an opportunity to
improve my writing skills. As the name suggests, the focus is going to be on 
speech-based human-machine interaction. This is a very interdisciplinary field
which allows us to look into many interesting topics such as real-time audio
processing, speech recognition, natural language processing, user interface
design and others.

I am planning to release practical guides, lessons learned and commentary on
recent advancements in the field. Furthermore, I am planning to share my
experience in designing and developing a real-time spoken dialog system.
