I am software engineer and researcher interested in building complex systems
based on state of the art research. My current intersts lie in machine
learning topics related to speech and image processing such as speech
recognition, speaker identification, dialogic applications, spoken language
understanding, natural language understanding and real-time engagement
detection. I earned my M.S by Research in Computing Science at
Staffordshire University, UK in 2015 and am currently enrolled as a part-time
graduate student at Columbia University.

Currently, I am a Research Engineer in the R&D division at Educational Testing
Service (ETS) in San Francisco. I lead the engineering efforts in the design
and development of the spoken dialog system HALEF and contribute to research
research in computer assisted language learning and behavioral assessment.
