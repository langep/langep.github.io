Professionally, I am a Software Development Engineer at Amazon working on applications of conversational AI research. Prior to joining Amazon, I was a Senior Research Engineer in the R&D division at Educational Testing Service (ETS) where I lead the engineering efforts in the design and development of the spoken dialog system HALEF and contribute to research research in computer assisted language learning and behavioral assessment.

When I do not try to talk to my computer, I like to develop small games in Unity3D, try out new technology and find the newest restaurant in town. I do enjoy continuous learning and am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at UC Davis.
